Here are some examples of me using ELIZA as a chat. You can quickly see where all it falls short.

## Example 1
```txt
ELIZA: Hello, I’m your therapist. Type 'quit' to exit.
You: I feel hungry 
ELIZA: When do you usually feel hungry?
You: Noon
ELIZA: Can you elaborate on that?
You: Bro i said afternoon
ELIZA: Please tell me more.
You: Shut up
ELIZA: How does that make you feel?
You: quit
ELIZA: Goodbye!
```

## Example 2
```txt
ELIZA: Hello, I’m your therapist. Type 'quit' to exit.
You: I need fortnite right now
ELIZA: Would it really help you to get fortnite right now?
You: Yes it would
ELIZA: Why do you say that?
You: Because I am addicted
ELIZA: How does that make you feel?
You: Happy
ELIZA: Can you elaborate on that?
You: I like the thrill
ELIZA: Can you elaborate on that?
You: quit
ELIZA: Goodbye!
```

## Example 3
```txt
ELIZA: Hello, I’m your therapist. Type 'quit' to exit.
You: Why don't you be useful
ELIZA: Perhaps eventually I will be useful.
You: Haha in 2025 yeah
ELIZA: Please tell me more.
You: quit
ELIZA: Goodbye!
```

Pretty easy to see how garbage this is - it solves no problems, only repeats smartly what we ask it to.
